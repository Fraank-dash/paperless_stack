todo: general description lorem ipsum

## general usecase

todo:
intended for just me myself and i as single user AND local use within the local network only. 
-> nothing special. just managing my own docs

## backup

quite important

## prod and test

todo: idea is to be to test and destroy while leaving the prod system unaffected by Layer8Problems

-> based on *backup*
